# Explicit Lyrics Rater

# WARNING: By using this application you accept that you may or may not read explicit words. The intent is not to promote the usage or spread of such foul language, but merely to assess its use in song lyrics. Proceed at your own comfort level.

The Explicit Lyrics Rater (ELR) allows you to paste song lyrics and have it return a Pandas DataFrame that includes a score of how explicit the song is. 
This score is determined by taking Google's list of explicit words and assigning scores to each word (ranked 1-8), depending on how 'bad' they are. This piece of the program is completely subjective. Feel free to change them for your own use.
The ELR also allows for data visualization by outputting the song's score as a bar in a bar chart for comparison to other bars.

An example output of what this may look like is in /out_img.png.

Thank you for your interest.
